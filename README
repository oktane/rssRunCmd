What it's for:
Tool to check an RSS feed for a new item and run an external command/application 
based on the contents of the item. Useful for fetching/processing items from 
development 'build release' feeds. 

How to use:
Edit INI file first. If one does not exist on first run, it will be created with 
default values. Detail of settings below.

[options]
### The URL of the feed. To test the demo feed, upload it somewhere and give the
### URL here.
feedURL=http://localhost/dummy.xml

### RegEx to operate on 'link' section of RSS item, to extract a filename or can 
### be simply .*
urlFilename_RegEx=^.*/

### Regex to extract UID used to cache item and provide {0} string formatter. 
### Extracted from urlFilename_RegEx. For example, this demo extracts the build 
### version number from Application_Build_12345.zip
urlUID_RegEx=^Application_Build_(\d+)\.zip

### The name of application/script to run (optionally with path)
exeToRun=testaction.bat

### Working directory when exeToRun is executed
exeWorkingDir=.

### Valid string formatters for the exeParams setting: {0} version/uid,
### {1} filename, {2} url, {3} pubdate, {4} title, {5} description
exeParams={0} {1} {2} "{3}" "{4}" "{5}"

### This is the section where the app keeps track of items it has already 
### processed. It is filled in automatically.
[ignore]
SomeUIDValue=processed
### or
12345=processed

After setting up the INI file, simply create a scheduled task to run 
rssRunCmd.exe on the schedule you desire. If the application that you run does 
not return a 'happy' errorcode (0) then the item will fail and be processed 
again the next time.
