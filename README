What it's for:
Tool to check an RSS feed for a new item and run an external command/application based on the contents of the item. Useful for fetching/processing items from development 'build release' feeds. 

How to use:
Edit INI file first. If one does not exist on first run, it will be created with default values. Detail of settings below.

[options]
### The URL of the feed. To test the demo feed, upload it somewhere and give the URL here.
feedURL=http://localhost/dummy.xml
### RegEx to operate on 'link' section of RSS item, to extract a filename or can be simply .*
urlFilename_RegEx=^.*/
### regex to extract UID used to cache item and provide {0} string formatter. Extracted from urlFilename_RegEx. For example, this demo extracts the build version number from Application_Build_12345.zip
urlUID_RegEx=^Application_Build_(\d+)\.zip
## The name of application/script to run (optionally with path)
exeToRun=testaction.bat
### Working directory when exeToRun is executed
exeWorkingDir=.
### Valid string formatters for the exeParams setting: {0} version/uid, {1} filename, {2} url, {3} pubdate, {4} title, {5} description
exeParams={0} {1} {2} "{3}" "{4}" "{5}"

### This is the section where the app keeps track of items it has already processed. It is filled in automatically.
[ignore]
SomeUIDValue=processed
or
12345=processed


After setting up the INI file, simply create a scheduled task to run rssRunCmd.exe on the schedule you desire.
